Custom Keymap for thinkpad E15

This is a fork of the us keymap found in `/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us`

I copied that file to `/user/share/X11/xkb/symbols/co`

Now I can make changes to that file and change that the keys on my keyboard type.

Change to custom keyboard layout with `setxkbmap co` and change back with `setxkbmap us`.
